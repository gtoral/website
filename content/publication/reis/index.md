abstract: "This article examines immigrant organizations from three
  perspectives: their relationships with public authorities, the system of
  relationships established among these organizations, and their degree of
  internal participation. My principal aim is to analyze the extent to which one
  can speak of a civil society in this domain. The study presented takes the
  case of immigrant organizations in Spain, focusing on those organizations that
  benefit from greater public recognition through the Forum for the Social
  Integration of Immigrants, a consultative body of the Government. In-depth
  interviews with chairpersons and workers in these organizations are combined
  with contributions from the literature on social movements, on ethnic
  mobilization and on social capital, to explain the Spanish situation.
  Connecting the dynamics of immigrant organizations with those of other social
  organizations in Spain, it is argued that the relationships established with
  public authorities are neither balanced out by a dense interorganizational
  network, nor harmonized by the active participation of their members. These
  factors work to the detriment of a true civil society in this domain, having
  negative implications for the organizations’ capacity to act as creators of
  social capital, and for the integration of immigrants. This brings into
  question the role of the State in supporting immigrant organizations"
