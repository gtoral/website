abstract: Prosecutors play a central role in enforcing the rule of law, including in combating corruption. Yet we lack systematic evidence on whether, and how, they succeed. I argue that prosecutors' anti-corruption work is more effective when they are physically present in the communities they oversee.
Being on the ground improves prosecutors' access to information and ability to exert both formal and informal pressure on local officials, and heightens politicians' sense of oversight. I test this theory using a causal event study of the deployment of state prosecutors in Brazil, drawing on rich administrative data on their location and activity. I find that the arrival of a prosecutor to a locality increases anti-corruption enforcement (including investigations and extra-judicial agreements), raises civil service hiring in the local bureaucracy, and reduces corruption in municipal finances---all without lowering budget execution.
I complement these quasi-experimental findings with insights from original surveys and in-depth interviews with both prosecutors and politicians. Together, the results offer rare causal evidence that autonomous prosecutors can enhance local governance---and that physical presence is a key driver of their effectiveness.
