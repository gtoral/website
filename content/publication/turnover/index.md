abstract: Electoral accountability is fundamental to representative democracy. Yet, it can also be costly for governance because it causes turnover among bureaucrats (not just elected officials) and disruptions in the delivery of public services. This article advances a theory of political turnover as a process that, starting the moment election results are published, leads to bureaucratic shuffles and depresses service delivery. I demonstrate these turnover dynamics through a close-races regression discontinuity design, using administrative data on public employment and on healthcare service delivery in Brazilian municipalities. The results show that an electoral defeat of the incumbent causes increases in dismissals, hires, and resignations of bureaucrats, and declines in public service delivery in the months following the election. These findings draw attention to the political strategies of lame-duck politicians, and highlight the intense and consequential bureaucratic politics that follow elections.
