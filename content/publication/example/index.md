abstract: Do voters reward politicians for the quality of public services? We
  address this question by studying voters' responses to signals of municipal
  school quality in Brazil, a setting particularly favorable to electoral
  accountability. Findings from a regression discontinuity design and a field
  experiment are strikingly consistent. Contrary to expectations, signals of
  school quality decrease electoral support for the local incumbent. However, we
  find the expected effect among citizens for whom school quality should be most
  salient—parents with children in municipal schools. Using an online survey
  experiment, we argue that voters who do not value education interpret school
  quality as an indicator of municipal policy priorities and perceive trade-offs
  with other services. Voters may hold politicians accountable not only for
  their competence but also for their representation of potentially conflicting
  interests—a fact that complicates the simple logic behind many accountability
  interventions.
