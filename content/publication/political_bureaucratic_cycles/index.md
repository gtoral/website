abstract: A vast literature on political cycles has shown that politicians often manipulate policy tools ahead of elections, as a strategy to improve their electoral performance. Much less is known about the effects of policies used to contain these cycles. I argue that legal constraints on politicians' discretion over inputs such as spending or hiring ahead of elections simply displace cycles and can even exacerbate them. I demonstrate these unintended consequences using large, monthly panels of Brazilian municipalities, and measuring cycles in bureaucratic inputs (hires) and outputs (services). Brazilian laws ban hiring and firing bureaucrats in a 6-month period around elections, which take place at the same time throughout the country. Hiring contracts during this freeze period but it expands in the months before the ban, for both temporary and civil service bureaucrats. These patterns are even more pronounced in localities exposed to a randomized anti-corruption audit. Healthcare services also follow cyclical patterns: some services expand ahead of the elections (at the expense of others), and in general services contract immediately before and after the election. Together, these results suggest that constraints on politicians' discretion over inputs around elections displace rather than eliminate electoral cycles, and can have other unintended consequences.
