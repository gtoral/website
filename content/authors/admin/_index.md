I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at [IE University](https://www.ie.edu/), and a Faculty Affiliate at [MIT GOV/LAB](https://mitgovlab.org/). I work in the fields of comparative politics and political economy, with a regional focus on Latin America and Southern Europe, and a substantive focus on issues of development, governance, and corruption.

My research agenda centers on relationships among state actors (politicians, bureaucrats, and anti-corruption agents), anti-corruption policies, and their impacts on public service delivery and human development. In my work, I use big administrative datasets, surveys, experimental and quasi-experimental designs, and extensive qualitative fieldwork.

Some of my work has been published or is forthcoming in the *American Journal of Political Science*, the *Journal of Politics*, and the *Annual Review of Political Science*.
